# This class should manage the queuing on the abstract idea of a social platform 
# (discord, IRC, etc). Currently, we assume a Discord-like featureset, but we
# should make sure to handle cases where the platform doesn't support things--eg:
# IRC won't let you delete messages, or react to them.
# This should map actions taken on a platform (eg: reaction) to the command the 
# action is intended to represent (eg: queue up).
# We'll figure this next part out later, but this class may not actually belong 
# here as in the ideal case, the bot shouldn't have to wait for the caller to provide
# it with a message id--which it needs to perform its duty.
#
# It should receive actions from the queue manager and translate them into message actions
# that the caller can perform. 
# eg: call_next -> host_next -> (CODE_DISPENSED) -> 
#     return [SEND_CODE (to guest), SEND_WARNING (to next guest), SEND_NOTIFICATION (to host)]
