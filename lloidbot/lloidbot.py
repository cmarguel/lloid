# This decorator denotes that the decorated method returns a list of 
# messages, in the form [(channel, key, *params, *on_sent, *on_fail)]. 
# The channel is any object that contains an async send(str) method, 
# which will be used to send the message. The key corresponds to a message
# that is defined in either the global `message` dict or the global `errors`
# dict, in that order of priority.
# The optional params argument is a dict of the keywords that are required 
# to format the message. 
# The optional on_sent argument is an async callback that is executed upon success
# of the message sending. It passes the Discord message object, as well as
# the message tuple that was just processed.
# The optional on_fail argument is an async callback that is executed when an exception
# occurs during message sending--for instance, if the channel blocks messages.
# It passes the error as well as the message tuple that errored out.
# All messages in the list are guaranteed to be processed by Lloid in order,
# although variable issues such as users' internet speeds and Discord's backend
# mean that near-simultaneous messages may not be received in order.
